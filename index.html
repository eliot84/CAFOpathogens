<h3>The U.S. CAFO</h3>

<p class="indent"> Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO), is a term coined by the US Environmental. A CAFO is a facility that raises animals at high-densities for the consumption of meat, eggs and milk. There are rewarding incentives in the current agricultural system to cultivate larger farms with lower costs that result in greater profits. This article does not focus on those rewards; instead, we wish to bring to light concern regarding the practices of these CAFO locations. Specifically, how they have the ability to impact the environment and human health through increased pathogenic cultivation. </p>

<p class="indent"> Waste management in large venues like these are concerning not only in situations where the amount of manure produced exceeds the demand for manure. Circumstances where water contamination and live stock become carriers of pathogens can become very difficult to resolve. </p>
<br /><br />
<h4> CAFO Classification by Minimum Size of Livestock</h4>
<p class="indent">The minimum count by animal type for a facility/farm to be considered a CAFO is shown below.</p>

<h3>Foodborne Outbreaks 1998 - 2008 by State </h3>
   <p class="indent"> Manure is valuable to the farming industry, but at large production quantities they become problematic. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified the single most pressing public health issue associated with CAFO locations specifically being the amount of manure they produce. Although manure contain plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, they also contain a variety of potential contaminants including bacterial and viral pathogens. Although sewage treatment plants are required for human waste, no such treatment facility exists for livestock waste at these CAFO locations. </p>

<h3>Confirmed CAFO Related Pathogen Outbreaks 1998 - 2008</h3>
<p class="indent"> There is great difficulty in determining the origins of a micro-organism, and this is especially true in situations where the pathogen is transferred through raw food and/or water. The following visualization shows the number of outbreaks and illnesses that have been confirmed by the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS)between 1998 - 2008. During this time period there were a confirmed 7,998 outbreaks reported involving foodborne pathogens.</p>

<h3>Number of Confirmed Pathogen Outbreaks from 1998 - 2008 with Illness Count</h3>
<p class="indent">The FDOSS collected more specifically collected data illustrated below that show the following information: </p>

<p>
<h4>Interpreting the below tree map</h4> 
1. Comparison of Outbreaks reported by rectangle size: larger rectangles show more incident of outbreaks than smaller ones <br /><br />
2. Comparison of Illnesses reported by color: blue hue's represent a lower amount of reported illnesses while red hue's represent a larger amount.
